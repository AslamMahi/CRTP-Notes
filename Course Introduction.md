# **What we will cover**

- [ ] **Introduction to Active Directory and Kerberos**
- [ ] **Introduction to Powershell**
- [ ] **Domain Enumeration (Attacks and Defense)**
- [ ] **Trust and Privileges Mapping**
- [ ] **Local Privilege Escalation**
- [ ] **Credential Replay Attacks (Over-PassTheHash, Token Replay etc.)**
- [ ] **Domain Privilege Escalation (Attacks and Defense)**
- [ ] **Dumping System and Domain Secrets**
- [ ] **Kerberos Attacks and Defense (Golden, silver tickets and more)**
- [ ] **Abusing Cross Forest Trusts (Attacks and Defense)**
- [ ] **Delegation Issues**
- [ ] **Persistence Techniques**
- [ ] **Abusing SQL Server Trusts in an AD Environment**
- [ ] **Bypassing Defenses**

# **Our End Goal**

- [ ] **Basic Prior Knowledge of Active Directory is needed**
- [ ] **Demonstrate how an attack can be executed and then have learning objective to practice what we have learnt**
- [ ] **The lab focuses on real world red team operations using built-in tools and focusing on functionality abuse**
- [ ] **No exploits and exploitation framework is needed**
- [ ] **We start from a foothold box as a normal domain user to domain admins**


# **Philosophy of This Course**

- [ ] **We will emulate an adversary  who has  a foothold machine on the target domain**
- [ ] **We will not use any exploit**
- [ ] **We will try to abuse functionality and features which are rarely patched**
- [ ] **We try to use built-in tools and avoid touching disk on any target and will not use exploit framework throughout the lessons**

# **What is Active Directory**

- [ ] A directory Service used to manage windows Network
- [ ] Stores information about objects on the network and makes it easily accessible by available users and admins
- [ ] Enables Centralized, secure management of an entire network across a building, a city or multiple locations throughout the world
