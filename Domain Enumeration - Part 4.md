## **What is Trusts**

- Trust is a relationship between two domains or forests which allows users of one domain or forest to access resources in the other domain or forest.
- Trust can be automatic (parent-child, same forest etc.) or established (forest, external).
- Trusted Domain Objects (TDOs) represent the trust relationships in a domain
